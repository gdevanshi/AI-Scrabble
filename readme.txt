This project is a computerized version of Scrabble. Unlike other Scrabble games, this project simply allows the user to click through to allow to computer players to make moves. Each time, the computer makes the optimal move based on the its hand. 

Also, a frequency heuristic is used to attempt to penalize the computer if it uses too many very frequently occurring letters too often. 

To run this project, download the pygame module and all additional files, including the Scrabble dictionary located in the Google Drive folder shared. All other data files are .png images also located in the shared folder. Then, run the Run.py file.

If the file freezes or runs too slow, go to line 70 and 72 in the Run.py file and change "abcde" to "abcd" for a shorter letter hand to implement the AI on.
